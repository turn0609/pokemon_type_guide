        <p class="introtextwithimage">A pokémon's type is a defining characteristic that determines its moveset, strengths, and weaknesses.
            To succeed in both in-game and competitive match-ups, understanding how to use types to strengthen your pokémon and counter your opponents pokémon is critical.
            <br> 
            <br>As of generation 9, there are 18 different pokémon types in the game.
            One of the unique things about Pokémon is that there is not a single “best” type.
            Each type is strong against some types and weak against others.
            Each type is consistent throughout the modern games, so matchups remain consistent through new releases.

<!----HOW DO TYPES WORK-->

    <h2 class="leftheader">How do pokémon types work?</h2>

    <p>Pokémon types can be seen like a game of rock, paper, scissors.
        Take the classic types of fire, water, and grass.
        Each of these types has its primary weakness within the “triangle”.
        Fire beats grass, grass beats water, and water beats fire.
        Each type within the game is involved in one of these triangles.
        When a type used hits a pokémon's weakness, the damage dealt is 2 times that of a standard attack.
        However, when a pokémon is resistant to a type, the damage is only 0.5 times that of a standard attack.
    </p>

            <img src="complex_weakness.jpg" height="300px">
        </div>
        <p class="cardtext">These strength/weakness flows become progressively more complicated as you consider more types.
            The diagrams below show the difference between a 5-type chart and a full 18-type chart.</p>
    </div>

   

    <p>These matchups can become more difficult when you consider that many pokémon have secondary types.
        A secondary type often comes out during evolutions or when catching high level pokémon.
        Both of a pokémon's types are subject to individual strengths and weaknesses.
        A super-effective hit will still only do 2x damage, and a non-effective hit will do 0.5x damage.
        However, if both types are hit at once, extra damage will be dealt.
        For example, if a fire-ground-type pokémon is hit with a water-type move, the damage dealt will be 4 times the standard damage.

<!-----PICKING A CORE POKEMON TYPE-->

    <h2 class="leftheader">Picking a core pokémon type</h2>

    <p>The first step to building an effective pokémon team is to pick a core type.
        When you're facing gym leaders in-game, picking a core pokémon type is simple.
        If you are fighting the fire-type gym you should have a water-type core.
        Knowing your opponent's core pokémon type before battle allows you to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>There are 18 known pokémon types as of the lastest release of Legends ZA.
        Here is a preview of each of the types and their corresponding icons:</p>

    <div class="typecontainer">

        <div class="typebadge "id="electric"> <span class="icon">l</span> ELECTRIC</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="steel"> <span class="icon">m</span> STEEL</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="dragon"> <span class="icon">n</span> DRAGON</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="poison"> <span class="icon">o</span> POISON</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="psychic"> <span class="icon">p</span> PSYCHIC</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="flying"> <span class="icon">v</span> FLYING</div>
        <div class="typebadge "id="fairy"> <span class="icon">y</span> FAIRY</div>
    </div>

    <p>When playing a true competitive match, selecting a core-type depends more on your strongest pokémon and playstyle preference.
        You do not have the advantage of knowing type-matchups before-hand.
        In this case, you can often just pick a type that you like to play and build your team around that.
        Depending on which specific pokémon game you are playing, there are certain types that are generally stronger than others.
        In Scarlet/Violet, dragon, fairy and steel types are some of the strongest in the game.</p>

    <p>Picking your core type does not mean you are limited to the moves of that type.
        As mentioned, pokémon often have secondary types that allow them to learn more moves through evolution.
        TMs (or technical machine) allow your pokémon to learn special moves both inside and outside of it's core type.
        For example, a grass-type pokémon may be able to learn ground, fairy, and poison moves through the use of TMs.
    <!---The sequence below showcases the many ways in which you can utilize and manipulate pokémon types.--->

<!-----PICKING COMPLEMENTARY TYPES-->

    <h2 class="leftheader">Picking complementary types</h2>

    <p>Picking a complementary type is less about eliminating weaknesses than it is about having weakness coverage.
        It is impossible to have a team immune all weaknesses.
        When considering building your team, you want to make sure that you have the weaknesses of your core type covered.
        Here are a few questions to get you started when considering complementary types:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>What type is most <b>effective</b> against my pokémon?</li>
        <li>What pokémon <b>counter</b> those effective attacks?</li>
        <li>Will <b>adding</b> that pokémon create good team coverage?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        A strong type defense allows you to swtich out your pokémon when a poor match-up happens.
        I'll go over a few examples of good complementary type picks based on some common core types.
    </p>

    <p>Below is an example team that covers the complementary trios of fire/water/grass and fighting/flying/rock. 
       Even having pokémon with single types in their trios adds options when your opponent threatens a super effective move.
       While not every element in the game is covered, this is a good and balanced team that can get you through much of the early game.
    </p>

    <div class="recessed-card">
        <div class="vertimg">
            <img src="exampleteam.png" width="800px">
            <img src="examplecoverage.png" width="800px">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Let's re-examine the fire/water/grass type triangle.
        While each pokemon has a weakness among the triangle, having all 3 types in your team creates complementary roles.
        A battle might look something like this:
    </p>

    <div class="recessed-card">
        <div class="centerimg">
        <button id="battlebutton"> Start Battle </button>
        </div>
        <div class="battle-player">
            <img src="charmander.png" height="100px">
            <p class="battle"> You lead with a <span id="fire" class="battletype">fire-type</span> pokémon. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="battle-opponent">
            <p class="battle">  The opponent is a <span id="water" class="battletype">water-type</span>. </p>
            <img src="squirtle.png" height="100px">
        </div>
        <div class="battle-player">
            <img src="bulbasaur.png" height="100px">
            <p class="battle">  You can safely switch to a <span id="grass" class="battletype">grass-type</span> to both avoid the hard-hitting <span id="water" class="battletype">water-type</span> attack and hit back with an effective <span id="grass" class="battletype">grass-type</span> attack. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="battle-opponent">
            <p class="battle">  Your opponent then switches to a <span id="fire" class="battletype">fire-type</span> to counter your <span id="grass" class="battletype">grass-type</span> and you can switch again to your <span id="water" class="battletype">water-type</span> to avoid weakness and create a better match-up. </p>
            <img src="charmander.png" height="100px">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="lasttext">This is just a basic example of having type coverage within your team.
        Having all 6 pokemon on your team allows you to create complementary pairs and trios of pokémon within your party.
        Having diverse pokémon with various weakness coverage is much more effective than having a party of a single type.
