        <h1>The basics of pokémon core and complementary types</h1>
    </div>

<!----INTRODUCTION-->

    <p>A pokémon's type is a defining characteristic that determines its moveset, strengths, and weaknesses.
        To succeed in both in-game and competitive match-ups, understanding how to use types to strengthen your pokémon and counter your opponents pokémon is critical.
        As of generation 9, there are 18 different pokémon types in the game.
        One of the unique things about Pokémon is that there is not a single “best” type.
        Each type is strong against some types and weak against others.
        Each type is consistent throughout the modern games, so matchups remain consistent through new releases. 
    </p>

   
<!----HOW DO TYPES WORK-->

    <h2>How do pokémon types work?</h2>

    <p>Pokémon types can be seen like a game of rock, paper, scissors.
        Take the classic types of fire, water, and grass.
        Each of these types has its primary weakness within the “triangle”.
        Fire beats grass, grass beats water, and water beats fire.
        Each type within the game is involved in one of these triangles.
        When a type used hits a pokémon's weakness, the damage dealt is 2 times that of a standard attack.
        However, when a pokémon is resistant to a type, the damage is only 0.5 times that of a standard attack.
    </p>

    </div>

    <div class="note">
        These strength/weakness flows become progressively more complicated as you consider more types.
        The diagrams below show the difference between a 5-type chart and a full 18-type chart.
    </div>

    <p>These matchups can become more difficult when you consider that many pokémon have secondary types.
        A secondary type often comes out during evolutions or when catching high level pokémon.
        Both of a pokémon's types are subject to individual strengths and weaknesses.
        A super-effective hit will still only do 2x damage, and a non-effective hit will do 0.5x damage.
        However, if both types are hit at once, extra damage will be dealt.
        For example, if a fire-ground-type pokémon is hit with a water-type move, the damage dealt will be 4 times the standard damage.
    </p>


<!-----PICKING A CORE POKEMON TYPE-->

    <h2>Picking a core pokémon type</h2>

    <p>The first step to building an effective pokémon team is to pick a core type.
        When you're facing gym leaders in-game, picking a core pokémon type is simple.
        If you are fighting the fire-type gym you should have a water-type core.
        Knowing your opponent's core pokémon type before battle allows you to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>When playing a true competitive match, selecting a core-type depends more on your strongest pokémon and playstyle preference.
        You do not have the advantage of knowing type-matchups before-hand.
        In this case, you can often just pick a type that you like to play and build your team around that.
        Depending on which specific pokémon game you are playing, there are certain types that are generally stronger than others.
        In Scarlet/Violet, dragon, fairy and steel types are some of the strongest in the game.</p>


<!-----PICKING COMPLEMENTARY TYPES-->

    <h2>Picking complementary types</h2>

    <p>Picking a complementary type is less about eliminating weaknesses than it is about having weakness coverage.
        It is impossible to have a team immune all weaknesses.
        When considering building your team, you want to make sure that you have the weaknesses of your core type covered.
        Here are a few questions to get you started when considering complementary types:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>What type is most <b>effective</b> against my pokémon?</li>
        <li>What pokémon <b>counter</b> those effective attacks?</li>
        <li>Will <b>adding</b> that pokémon create good team coverage?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        A strong type defense allows you to swtich out your pokémon when a poor match-up happens.
        I'll go over a few examples of good complementary type picks based on some common core types.
    </p>

    <p>Let's re-examine the fire/water/grass type triangle.
        While each pokemon has a weakness among the triangle, having all 3 types in your team creates complementary roles.
        A battle might look something like this:
    </p>

    <p class="battle">
       * You lead with a <span class="orange">fire-type</span> pokémon.
        <br>* The opponent is a <span class="blue">water-type</span>.
        <br>* You can safely switch to a <span class="green">grass-type</span> to both avoid the hard-hitting <span class="blue">water</span> attack and hit back with an effective <span class="green">grass</span> attack.
        <br>* Your opponent then switches to a <span class="orange">fire-type</span> to counter your <span class="green">grass-type</span> and you can switch again to your <span class="blue">water-type</span> to avoid weakness and create a better match-up.
    </p>

    <p>This is just a basic example of having type coverage within your team.
        Having all 6 pokemon on your team allows you to create complementary pairs and trios of pokémon within your party.
        Having diverse pokémon with various weakness coverage is much more effective than having a party of a single type. 
    </p>
